Fungus is pretty interesting stuff if you think about it. I'm always fascinated if I stumble across a rotting log in the woods and find some otherworldly formation growing out of it. They always strike me as vaguely alien even though part of me (the part of my mind that tends to lecture me, with the relentless logic of a Vulcan) knows this is one of the most basic forms of Earth life there is.

Nonetheless, when a tree dies it doesn't always fall; it might remain standing there looking more or less as it did before, though leafless and somehow hollow-looking. The tree, which before had been a familiar thing of browns and greens, of rhythmic branches and patches of moss and sturdy roots and occasional knotholes, now begins to erupt with shelf fungus. Asymmetric, bulbous, randomly-sprouting, unpredictable stuff. It's harvesting the remaining energy in the tree
