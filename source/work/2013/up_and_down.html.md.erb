I was hiking in the mountains back home on a cold, overcast day and I came across a very old tree. Dead on its feet, its bark was starting to split and rot away. Shelf fungus had begun to grow and climb its trunk, forming bulbous, rhythmic stairsteps that reached toward the branches. The shapes and patterns of fungus fascinate me. I don't know why, exactly, but there's something both alien and familiar, something both playful and a little unsettling about it.

It's a kind of death knell for a tree, isn't it? When the tree has started to rot, the fungus harvests the remaining energy and those blooms appear.
