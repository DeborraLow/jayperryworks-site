[Diwali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali) is this week! I love the symbolism of the ‘festival of lights’ and find the tradition incredibly beautiful and inspiring.

One of my favorite bits of verse is from a Sanskrit hymn called _Jyota se jyota_, which Diwali often reminds me of.

_Mera antara timira mitavo_
_Sadguru jyota se jyota jagavo_

Loosely translated, that is:

_Remove the darkness covering my heart_
_Light my light with yours, Lord_[^1]

Those two short lines strike me as one of the most profound and sincere prayers I’ve ever heard, and I try to remember them often. May we all see by one another’s light this week.

[^1]: _Sadguru_ is a complex, nuanced word which is hard to translate. “Lord” is a usage that probably sounds familiar to many Jews and Christians, but it can also be translated as “(enlightened) teacher,” or even “true/highest self.” Broken down, the prefix _sad_ means "true" while _guru_ means roughly "light in the darkness," but often, of course, is used to describe teachers and spiritual guides. _Sadguru_, then, is a single word that carries much of the depth and richness of Hindu Advaita and Shaivite thought, and I believe you could spend a lifetime contemplating it’s many layers of meaning.
