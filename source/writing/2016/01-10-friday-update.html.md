My brother Andy went to Germany this summer as part of a research project for the engineering degree he's working on. My brother is a huge gearhead, talented mechanic, and a fan of heavy stout-style beer, so Germany is essentially paradise for him. This three-month trip would also be his first experience living abroad, immersed in a language that he didn't speak natively (he had a few years of German classes under his belt, though). In short: it would be an adventure.

Once he'd caught up with his jetlag and found a few minutes to himself, Andy wrote us an email update that described a pretty great week: meeting lots of other students and professors, digging into his research, and (as shown in an enclosed photo) lots of excellent-but-inexpensive beer to be had at picturesque sidewalk cafes. Germany was more than living up to expectations, and Andy started sending his email updates each Friday. Andy's an excellent writer, and his emails were filled with funny stories and interesting details. His _Fritag Abend_ ("Friday Update") became a kind of newsletter with a growing list of subscribers. 

As a Christmas gift, I decided to print his emails and bind them in a hardcover as a kind of permanent momento. Bookbinding is a hobby of mine; I've done half a dozen blank sketchbooks and journals for myself and friends, but this would be the first time I worked with typeset pages.
