I have started making spreadsheets for my daily routine.

Actually, to be honest, I find this quite helpful. Somebody sent me [this great chart](https://podio.com/site/creative-routines), awhile back, about the routines of various artists and writers, and I was kind of relieved to see how much they varied. Some worked all night and slept until noon, while other folks got up at 4am and quit before breakfast. The one common denominator seemed to be that everybody kept a strict routine, day in, day out. A productive artist is often one you can set your watch by.

As of this year, I now have a baby and an old house in the mix, so keeping a schedule has become desperately important if I'm going to get any work done at all.

Taking the time to chart out my day is surprisingly good for lowering my blood pressure: everything gets a time and place. I don't have to plan on my feet as much.
