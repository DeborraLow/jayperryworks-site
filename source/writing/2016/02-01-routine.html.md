Actually, to be honest, I find this quite helpful. Somebody sent me [this great chart](https://podio.com/site/creative-routines), awhile back, about the routines of various artists and writers, and I was kind of relieved to see how much they varied. Some worked all night and slept until noon, while other folks got up at 4am and quit before breakfast. The one common denominator seemed to be that everybody kept a strict routine, day in, day out. A productive artist is often one you can set your watch by.

As of this year, I have a baby and an old house in the mix. Sometimes I feel like I'm constantly fighting for time to do my work amid a thousand other obligations and distractions. That feeling is a trap I fall into every now and then -- it's a panicky form of self-pity and really not a good side of myself to show. Sometimes life is busy and sometimes life is chaotic, but I find that OH NOS! I'LL NEVER DRAW AGAIN! feeling, really, is less about having a lack of _time_ than about losing sight of the big picture. The fact is, it is indeed possible to make things while raising a child and keeping a house from falling down, but it's taken some work to find the holes in my day where I can fit in, say, an hour of sketching or revising a new chapter.

Taking the time to chart out my day in a ridiculous spreadsheet is one of those things that seems like the worst kind of OCD overkill (and the opposite of what a stereotypically "creative" person should want), but what it actually does is lower my blood pressure. It is, first, written proof that I can dedicate 2 hours a day to making things, while also eating and exercising and sleeping. And second, it's a blueprint I can follow. Everything gets a time and place, everything I need to do gets covered. I don't have to plan on my feet all the time, worrying that I won't get to something.

Something I've become increasingly aware of as I've gotten older is that, at least in my case, "creativity" requires stability. And by "stability" I mean feeling reasonably secure and organized in the rest of my life. Contrary to the stereotype of the Loopy Creative Person, I find it almost impossible to draw or write well if I'm worried about, say, paying the bills or hitting a deadline at work or dealing with a family emergency. It's true that some of the hardest parts of my life have inspired a lot of the work I'm doing now. But while those experiences might have given me new insights or stories to tell, I couldn't _execute_ the work in the middle of all that stress and fear. First I had to get myself to a more secure place, where I could finally relax and focus on the piece. Some people, no doubt, are able to quiet their minds or shut off worries more easily than me; some can focus in the middle of chaos. But for me, I am most productive when my life is the most boring.

So: I make spreadsheets and follow a routine. It's a simple practice I'd highly recommend to anyone feeling their days slipping away too fast.
