A nice (and thought-provokigin) interview: Walker Art Center talks to Google Design about their “Material Design” culture: http://blogs.walkerart.org/design/2016/03/24/material-rob-giampietro-amber-bravo-google-design

"Material Design is an open-source product and we treat it as such with regular updates and improvements that we share widely. On our team, designers and engineers work very closely together to build, and, perhaps even more crucially, maintain the system and services we develop. That’s a hallmark of our work at Google Design—the fact that we’re lead by design and engineering in equal measure."

[2:21] 
And I agree lots and lots with Khoi Vinh’s comments on it:

[2:21] 
"This conforms to what I find interesting about Material Design: I’m less impressed by Google’s construction of a comprehensive aesthetic (although it is quite attractive) than by Google’s development of an expansive design culture. Material maintains a very tricky balance between establishing dicta and engendering participation in a conversation with its users—designers and developers—about design."

[2:23] 
IMHO material design as a branding/UI library is lovely and has lots of great ideas about how a design system should work across lots of contexts and devices. but what’s most exciting about it is the way they’ve very carefully built it around a bottom-up, “open source” culture that parallels their engineering/dev work. there’s no geniuses locked in dark towers issuing dictats to the masses; the design is seen as a shared, distributed thing everyone can contribute to.

[2:25] 
okay, one more nice quote: "In terms of the “virtualization” of material that you ask about, Material Design is a system for thinking about our digital surfaces that uses the traditional tenets of graphic design to suit this new context most appropriately. So, for example, with mobile devices, once you remove the mouse or other pointing device, then you are actually interacting with a surface, and the affordances of that surface—its materiality—become critical. So while it is virtualized, it’s also being touched. It’s still mediated, but less so. And that closer proximity to the interface offers a new set of opportunities."

[2:29] 
^ hell of an interesting point there and gets right at one of the hardest questions of current UI design: “is the screen a flat surface that responds to you (a la a twitter feed on your phone), or is it a window into a space with depth (a la 3d games)?” and of course the correct answer is that it’s both. so how do you reconcile those?
