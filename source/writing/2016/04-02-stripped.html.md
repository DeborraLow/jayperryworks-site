I finally watched the documentary ["Stripped"](http://www.strippedfilm.com) this weekend after having it on my Netflix cue for about a year and a half. Not sure why I waited -- it was wonderful: beautifully shot, edited, and I appreciate the optimistic tone. It was especially exciting to hear an interview with Calvin & Hobbes' creator, Bill Watterson.  The other great part was that it covered a half dozen webcomics I wasn't familiar with, which should occupy me for the next month or so reading up on all of them.
