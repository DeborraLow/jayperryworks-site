I stumbled across [this review](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2018/10/20/a-visionary-abstract-artist-finally-gets-her-due) of early 20th century Swedish painter Hilda af Klint and I'm pretty blown away by it. For one, her work was staggeringly innovative: her experiments with abstraction and spiritualist-inspired painting predate Kandinsky, Miro, and Klee by _decades_. But I also think her stuff is simply beautiful. Despite the stylistic and thematic similarities with her male contemporaries, there's a precision and care in her compositions that strikes me as unique. They feel kind of _graphic_ in a way, inviting and elegant enough to be equally at home on a poster or a gallery wall. But it was, of course, the gallery walls that were forbidden to her.

The fact that her work - and that of countless other women artists of her time and long before - was alternately ignored and dismissed for (literally) 100 years is yet another reminder of Modernism's unintended legacy. The was to create a universal, more democratic way of seeing and creating and living. But that "universal" aesthetic the founders imagined extended only to people who looked and thought just like themselves. That is to say: rich white dudes.

In af Klintâ€™s work it's clear that this blindness and prejudice robbed the world of one of the geniuses of the 20th century.
